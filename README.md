## DEPI (Data Analytics Power BI Final Project)

## üìå Introduction:  

The hotel industry is vital to the global economy, providing accommodation, services, and experiences to travelers for leisure and business purposes. As a customer-focused sector, hotels rely on data analysis to understand guest behavior, optimize operations, and enhance decision-making. Businesses can improve revenue strategies by analysing booking data, identifying trends, and delivering tailored services in this competitive and dynamic industry. 

## üìå Data source:  

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mojtaba142/hotel-booking/data  

## üìå Dataset Overview: 

The dataset contains hotel booking information for two hotels between the 1st of July 2015 and 31st of August 2017 and includes booking details, customer information, and reservation status. 

## üìå Main Objective of this Project:  

Provide a comprehensive overview of hotel booking performance, identify key factors influencing booking patterns and cancellation generation, and enable data-driven decision-making to optimize operations and reduce cancellations for the City Hotel and Resort Hotel properties.
